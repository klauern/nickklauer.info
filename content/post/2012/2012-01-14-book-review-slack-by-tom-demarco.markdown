[![Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1320419657m/123715.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack)[Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack) by [Tom DeMarco](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38238.Tom_DeMarco)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/256690418)

Meh. 

I'm sure this is full of really useful information for people unfamiliar with it, but after having read Drive by Dan Pink, as well as having witnessed leadership in the military and warzones, this kind of fell flat for me. 

Most of the advice and information felt like common sense to me, so maybe it's valuable to another demographic, I don't know. If there are people that look at this and think their entire management style has been wrong, I sure hope they figure it out soon, because I wouldn't want to work with you nor would I tolerate your behavior if I was your superior.
