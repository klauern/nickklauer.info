One of the neat things I found out about StackOverflow is that it can collect up and present you an email summary every day with questions that fit some search of yours.  In my case, I created a daily email to send me questions related to Clojure across all of StackOverflow's sites:


## http://stackexchange.com/filters/45983/clojure




I've been subscribed to this for a while, and I find it incredibly useful.  I think alot of people forget that users aren't comfortable using IRC to ask questions, or think the mailing list is for the geeks-only crowd, and I find that Stackoverflow seems like one of those sites that's more approachable for your 'average joe' user, or at least alot of people who think they are just 'average'.

Contribute, subscribe, rejoice. :)
