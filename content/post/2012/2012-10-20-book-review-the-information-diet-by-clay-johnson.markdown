![](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1327911076l/12799077.jpg) tl;dr -  Overall 3/5.  I don't know if I would really recommend this to anybody I know, but I'm sure this will be new information for someone.

The premise of the book is simple.  You know that some foods are bad for you because they're mostly junk food.  They are there for your enjoyment, but do little other than hurt your heatlh.  Eating fast food every day is a sure way to obesity and high cholesterol. These kinds of things aren't mysteries.  We still enjoy those foods, but we also know that there are good foods to eat, such as fresh vegetables, fruits, and minimizing intakes of salt, etc.

How about taking that same metaphor towards the information you consume?  Lots of information out there is junk posing as good for you.  This book helps to identify that divide between what is merely **affirmation** news as opposed to **information** news.  Does it challenge your viewpoint, or reinforce biases you already have?

I breezed through this book on a short drill weekend in the few hours before I fell asleep.  It probably took me 4 - 5 hours tops to read it, with distractions (~150 pages).  What this book does is book-ify a metaphor, and try to fill it with content for 150 pages. Ironically, for a book about being a conscious consumer of information, the writing lacked focus and depth.

I was really excited to read this book because I was hoping to get alot of good tools out of it for both impacting how I consume information, as well as tools for helping others change how they interpret their own.  I got neither out of it, mostly because I know that sites like the Huffington Post and Drudge Report (as well as the TV versions MSNBC, Daily Show, and Fox News) all lack credibility in my mind in doing much more than entertaining me.



If you want to read this book, go ahead.  It's not going to take too long.
