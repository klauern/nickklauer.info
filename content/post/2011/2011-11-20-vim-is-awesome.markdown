I don't post much, so I'll skip pretending I do this alot and just get to my point:




ViM is Awesome.




It works on Windows, Linux, OS X (where MacVim is the only sensible GUI option), and I have alot of fun in it.




Some links:






  * [Steve Losh's vimrc](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/.vimrc) (be prepared to be way confused if you're not familiar with ViM configuration)


  * [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) (Very good.  I only wish I had it on Windows)


  * [vanilla ViM for the rest of us](http://www.vim.org) (Honestly, it's pretty good if you can configure it, and from my daily use, I find it works pretty well, good fonts, fast, etc.)


  * [My own .vim/ directory](https://github.com/klauern/dot-vim) (it works for me, but it's really quite a bit of a copy of alot of Steve Losh's stuff.  I just happen not to use HG, Django, PHP, etc., and don't find alot of the plugin settings very useful or necessary)







I've tried and dabbled in Emacs, but I haven't had a really good reason to move away from Vim.  From what I've gathered, if you're a Lisp junkie (and like Clojure), it's probably the better option, but otherwise, there's so much similarity between the two that it makes picking between Emacs and Vim a bit of a tossup.




I've likened it to this: in Vim, the experience is often one for a sysadmin.  Someone logs into a computer, types in `vim`, and gets to work on setting or changing some config setting somewhere.  It grew quite a bit out of that from the good-ol `vi` days, but the point of Vim was to be a good editor for quick changes.




I have yet to see the equivalent for Emacs, but again, from what I've read, Emacs is meant to be the one-stop-place-for-everything, and that you live and breathe in that thing.  People have written plugins to manage your [email in them](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryMail), your [to-do lists and projects](http://orgmode.org/), and [run code on-the-fly](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/), as is common in the Lisp paradigm.  In short, the productivity gains you get from never leaving Emacs make it a worthwhile tool to use.  It steps broadly out into the gray area between Text Editor, Lisp IDE, and OS, and frankly does quite a bit more than you would expect a text editor to do.







So, I may try Emacs again, but right now, Vim has a [plethora of plugins](http://vim-scripts.org/), [tools](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), and [neat tricks and treats](http://vimgolf.com/), that I feel reach a sweet spot in my own working environment that I'm hard-pressed to want to look elsewhere.







P.S.  If you're interested, sign up to receive notices about [VimConf](http://www.vimconf.org/?s=4WV), a proposed online conference around ViM and learning to be as productive in it as possible.
