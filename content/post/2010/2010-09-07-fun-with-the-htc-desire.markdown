So it's been a little kept secret of mine that I have a new phone, the HTC
Desire.  It's a pretty awesome phone, although I'm often asking myself if I
even need this thing at all or whether its just an expensive toy(I think
everyone could argue the latter).  In any event, as part of my interest in
technology relates to my care path, it's only proper that I try to keep
abreast of neat technologies in hopes of catching a bug and writing
something fun in it.





Anyway, this post is just being done with the phone right now, so I hope it
turns out well and I hope to push out more thoughts this way whether urge
hits me.  Here's to hoping.
