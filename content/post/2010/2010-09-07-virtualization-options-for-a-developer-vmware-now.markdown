So I have been recently trying to get my HP Elitebook 8440p to work properly with a VM.  I have long been a fan of Linux, Unix, BSD, and OS X, so having to use Windows for my day job really tends to bring me down.  I had a working desktop for Linux, but unfortunately it only works when I'm at the office, not out of office (VPN settings and all that).  So I'm back to trying again, only this time I want to do it through a VM, since that at least affords me the chance to fal back to NAT traversal for proxy settings and such, letting Windows handle in-office and out-of-office network settings.
