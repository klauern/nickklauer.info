I haven't really been able to understand whether Google Wave is an incremental improvement over email (and GMail) or whether it truly poses a gamechanging experience in communication until recently.  I was listening to a podcast on IBM's IOD '09 conference titled, "[Getting IT and business on the same page](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/scott/entry/iod_09_getting_it_and_the_business_on_the_same_page2?lang=en_us)".  In this short podcast, the speaker talks about how all of these BI and analytic tools work well for business, but at the end of the day, they use Excel, email, and MS Word to put all of this data together and communicate amongst themselves.  I believe the argument made was that IT needed more involvement in helping facilitate communication in this manner, possibly by hooking into email, facilitating dialogue with business leaders and IT, etc.  However, my thoughts over hearing that snippet came pretty quickly:









  * Why does the business subvert the reporting tool almost immediately?


  * What tools are business leaders familiar with?


  * Where can that gap be closed?




Once I heard him mention that business leaders simply_ export these reports into Excel_, then pass that report around in _emails with other business members_, I immediately keyed on what I think is the biggest issue with software tools are: **siloing**.  Nearly all middleware tools provide a walled garden experience with their data from the outset, and integrate as needed (or possible) with extra functionality, tools, plugins, etc.  Analytic tools provide an end result document that can be seen as simply a report.  They help people discover issues, provide useful metrics for a team, and can even provide alerting on sudden changes  that are important.  They don't **share**, however.







So [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/), right?  This is what immediately made me realize what Google was actually trying to accomplish.  While Wave is as much of a silo as the BI tools are, the purpose of Wave is to subvert email entirely as a means of communication.  It's been said before that email doesn't promote conversations--merely that it provides soundboards and glorified BBS message boards.  From my experience in IT, this is generally true.  People can't make sense of email chains when conversations diverge from one topic to another in separate threads.  One email may contain a snippet of information in it, another contains another separate snippet, but they are on two wholly different messages that you need to keep together somehow.  The clutter of multiple people doing "Reply All" makes for keeping the conversation in context a mess and frankly troublesome.







Wave attempts to get this right by being a focal point for one thing: conversation.  I don't think it's surprising that it's aims are grander.  When Email started showing how difficult it was to manage multiple messages, people realized they needed something else.  Soon we had wiki's, Sharepoint, and numerous ways to try to collaborate with each other on a topic.  Now we have Google Wave.  Will this really bring the collaboration around a topic we've been hoping for.  I would like to think it could.  It certainly has the potential to make rich content of conversations.  Wiki's are rich for creating content.  I don't see them providing the conversation we've wanted, just the end result of that conversation.  Wave brings both to the table, and tries to do it in a simple fashion.







I only hope that more people can get onboard with Wave.  Part of my wish is to see an open-sourcing of the client side web app of Wave.  The federation server is open source, but this is like merely providing an IMAP server as source.  You still need to find a suitable client for it, which I don't think we have an abundance of and will need if we hope to supplant email at all.







Here's to progress.
