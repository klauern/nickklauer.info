"I've researched the options and come to the conclusion..."

- without showing the evidence
- without comparing the options beyond a couple bullet points discussed in a previous meeting
-without sharing anything gathered other than your decision.

I'm more irked that someone can write this and be taken seriously without more criticism or analysis expected of them. 

With this particular issue, we've discussed the options endlessly, and to have it boil down to someone highlighting two or three bullet points that we'd already talked about, just reinforces the lack of rigor and frankly professionalism I've gotten tired of seeing.  People are too comfortable with what's right in their face, and lack in my opinion the discipline to highlight pros and cons of options.  They don't even look beyond the simple things we don't need compared.

If I were researching cars,I would factor all of the things I do with the car and how I plan to use it to make a decision.  With this "thorough"analysis, it's like they focussed simply on safety ratings, prioritizing that over every other combination of features.  You'll get a safe car, but wing be able to fit your kids in the back seat because you overlooked the real need to fit car seats in the back. This is what distracts me from doing work, because of the lack of rigor or actual analysis I would expect others to do. It's not to say I would make a better choice, but I would leave you with little doubt **why** I picked what I did, because all of the things I used to make the decision would be there. 

I look at what I present as something to expect criticism, and I could easily tear this to shreds because of an obvious lack of analysis done by the person presenting it.

I give up.  If this is what counts as thorough analysis, I'm going to have to look elsewhere to surround myself with people that will push the status quo further and challenge me. I'm certainly not feeling like there is anyone here to challenge it.
